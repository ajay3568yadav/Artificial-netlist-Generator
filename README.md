# Artificial-netlist-Generator
An artificial netlist generator for creating netlists, to fullfill the need for data to train machine learning models, this project is currently under active development.
this project utilizes gradient based transfer learning approach between a GNN and a GAN to incorporate timing properties in a artifically generated netlist.

## this project is currently being developed by the VDA Lab at Arizona State University https://github.com/ASU-VDA-Lab
